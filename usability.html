<h2> Usability Testing </h2>
<h3> Method </h3>
<p> The website I studied was the Yale Art School website. The target audiences for 
</br> this website are most likely high school students who are interested in attending the Yale Art School, or 
</br> students who already attend the Yale Art School who are looking for information of some sort. The tasks I 
</br> was assigned were to find the Summer Programs tab, then find information about the beginner summer program,
</br> and then find contact information on how to apply for this program.  </p>
<h3> Results </h3>
<p> Overall, the webiste's usability is bad and the design of the website does not make it easy to easily find
</br> or read information. To me this is kind of weird since it is the website for an art school that can be 
</br> edited by the students. The first task was the only one I was able to complete, where Summer Programs was 
</br> listed right in the navigation bar. After that, I was unable to find the beginner program information and 
</br> therefore I could not find the contact information or the application process either. </p>
