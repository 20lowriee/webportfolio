<h2 id="evaluation"> Evaluation of Web Graphics </h2>
<h3 id="evaluation"> Website I - <a href="https://www.apple.com/"> Apple, Inc. </a> </h3>
<ul id="evaluation"> <strong>
	<li> The purpose of the graphics on this website are to show the company’s products and make them appealing for potential buyers. </li> 
	<li> The graphics on this website enhance the user experience and have special features. For example, if a user scrolls down on a 
		</br> page of the website, a graphic will move or become a different photo. I think this is a cool way to show products and help 
		</br> increase online sales of products. </li> 
	<li> The graphics enhance the design of the website and meet many of the guidelines in the article. For example, the graphics fit in 
		</br> with the site’s purpose, which is to sell the products and show all tech specs, the website loads quickly, the graphics are not too
		</br> distracting and the focus is still on the main content, the photos are not too obnoxious and there is a website theme, all content 
		</br> can still be viewable and understandable without the graphics, and most text on the site is black on white, which provides great
		</br> contrast for the viewer. This website meets all of the website graphic guidelines. </li>

<h2 id="filetypes"> Graphic File Types </h2>
<h3 id="evaluation"> Image I </h3>
<p id="filetypes"> For this image of a graph, I believe it would be the most beneficial to save this image as an SVG file. This is because this image may need to 
		</br> be displayed on many platforms, in various sizes. This information will need to be delivered to anyone because it is statistical data dislayed
		</br> on a graph. </p>
<h3 id="evaluation"> Image II </h3>
<p id="filetypes"> For this next image of a monkey, I think it should be saved as a JPG file. JPG files are used mostly for photography with colors and this
		</br> photo meets both of those standards. </p>
<h3 id="evaluation"> Image III </h3>
<p id="filetypes"> For this image of a mountain, I think it should be saved as a JPG file. I think this because it is photography that uses many colors, and JPG
		</br> files are great for these types of images. </p> 
<h3 id="evaluation"> Image IV </h3>
<p id="filetypes"> For this next image of puzzle pieces, I think it should be saved as a PNG-8 file. This is because these files are good for icons and transparent 
		</br> images without many colors, and these images of puzzle pieces are solid colors and are also web icons. </p>
<h3 id="evaluation"> Image V </h3>
<p id="filetypes"> For the last image of a stop sign, I think it should be saved as a PNG-8 file. PNG-8 files are good for photos with a transparent background,
		</br> which this image does have. </p>
